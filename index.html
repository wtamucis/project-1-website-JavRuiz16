<h2>Welcome to the Dirt</h2>
<p>
This site is a practical companion for exploring singletrack—designed for runners stepping off the road and into the wild. You’ll find <b>actionable basics</b>, approachable training ideas, and pointers on gear that actually matters. The goal is confidence: read a bit, lace up, and go.
</p>
<p>
Trails vary wildly: smooth pine‑needle paths, rocky limestone ledges, sandy washes. Understanding surface and grade helps you pace smartly. Expect hikes on steep climbs, quick steps on descents, and an <i>even effort</i> rather than a fixed pace.
</p>
<p>
Start by browsing our <a href="tips.html">Top Tips</a> for quick wins, then dig into the <a href="about.html">About</a> page for themes like safety, nutrition, and route planning. Every page includes an image stored in the <code>images/</code> folder—keep filenames lowercase with no spaces.
