<h2>Five Quick Wins</h2>
<p>
Small adjustments pay off fast on dirt. These tips focus on control, efficiency, and enjoyment—because a fun run today makes it easier to run again tomorrow. Consider this your <b>low‑friction checklist</b> before heading out.
</p>
<p>
Remember that pace on trails is slower than roads. Judge effort with breathing and conversation, not your road splits. It’s normal to walk steep grades and <i>shuffle</i> tricky descents.
</p>
<p>
Keep notes after each run about terrain, shoes, and fueling. Patterns emerge quickly and help you dial things in.
</p>


<ol>
<li><b>Start easy</b>: choose short, loopable routes with good footing. Build time‑on‑feet before speed.</li>
<li><b>Footwork first</b>: shorten your stride, quicken cadence. Think light, quiet steps.</li>
<li><b>Hydrate smart</b>: bring water for anything >45–60 minutes; add electrolytes in heat or humidity.</li>
<li><b>Etiquette</b>: yield to uphill traffic, announce passes, and leash dogs where required.</li>
<li><b>Safety</b>: check weather, tell someone your route, carry a small kit (band‑aid, tape, gel, whistle).</li>
</ol>
